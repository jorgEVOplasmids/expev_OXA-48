# Analysis of the evolution of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance through WGS

In this repository you'll find all the code developed for the analysis of WGS data resulting from the experimental evolution of clinical bacterial strains carrying pOXA-48, a carbapenem-resistance plasmid of great relevance. Additionally to the Python and R scripts shown in this GitHub, other software have been necessary to analyze all the data in an exhaustive way:
